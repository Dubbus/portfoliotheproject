# Portfolio Project

Hello! This is Adarsh Muralidharan's BookRecommender Java Component.

It recommends books using a Breadth-First-Search Algorithm, and uses Java Records to Organize Books, allowing you to track Books you've read, then get recommendations based on other books in your catalog.


There are Demos available in the src file!


Thank you to Jeremy Grifski at The Ohio State University for giving me lots of guidance and help throughout the development of this project.
